== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to get started? =

Download the edelpaper WordPress Plugin from WordPress Plugin Directory to your WordPress installation. WordPress will ask you for your FTP/SSH password to perform the installation request. After installation you have to activate the Plugin under the WordPress menu “Plugins”.

The first time you access the newly created edelpaper Plugin in your control panel, you will be asked for register this installation. The Registration is free of charge and without obligation, but yet necessary to provide every user with their respective edelpaper flip books which are hosted in our SSL secured cloud by the service edelpaper.com. You have to click “Request new API Key” and you will be forwarded to the edelpaper.com Sign up for registration.

After successful sign up on edelpaper.com you can immediately start uploading your PDF files in your WordPress Plugin and your first edelpaper flipbook will be created. Finally, you can embed it into your WordPress blog or website by using shortcodes or the edelpaper WordPress widget. You can share your flip books via Permalink on other websites or social media networks as well.

= How about the document quality and filesize? =

The edelpaper flip book can only be as good as your given PDF. Save your document as an web-optimized version.

We recommend using the PDF/A-1b standard. Single pages (not spreads) in one PDF. The fonts used in your document need to be embedded in the PDF-file. Don't use very complex vector graphics within your document. Preferably 150 dpi resolution.

It is possible to process higher dpi values but the quality experienced by the reader won't increase noticeably while viewing common document sizes. Whereas the file size will increase noticeably. Make sure all pages are the same size. If not, some pages might be cut off, due to the automatic correction by the player.

edelpaper is designed to convert any publication dimensions and represent your publication as a true reflection of its print counter part. It does not matter if your publication is a tabloid magazine, broadsheet newspaper, square, A3, A4 or A5. Whatever its shape edelpaper will interpret and convert.

There is a maximum file size of 600 MB/publication. For your own convenience and upload time, they should be as small as possible. Note however, that there is no converter that down- or upscales the files to a specific dpi-value.

= Are there any costs for the use of this plugin? =
